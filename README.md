### 👋 Hi

I'm **Sunny**, a backend engineer focused on building scalable, observable, high‑performance services in **Go** (microservices, gRPC, REST). I work on concurrency patterns, performance tuning, profiling, and reliability. I also have some **iOS (Swift / UIKit)** background and am currently learning **Vue + modern TypeScript** to round out full‑stack skills.

---
#### 🧩 Tech Stack
- Go (concurrency, performance tuning, Gin/Fiber, gRPC)
- Datastores: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, pprof, tracing / OpenTelemetry
- iOS: Swift (UIKit fundamentals)
- Learning: Vue, JavaScript / TypeScript

---
#### 🚀 Current Focus
- Deepening observability (tracing, metrics, profiling)
- Frontend fundamentals (component design, state management, build tooling)
- Long‑term fitness & weight management (already lost 20kg; refining training & nutrition)

---
#### 🏃 Interests
- Distance running & marathons (structured training, pacing, HR zones)
- Health, recovery, strength, nutrition
- Designing simple, reliable, maintainable services
